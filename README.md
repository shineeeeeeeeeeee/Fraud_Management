# Aadhaar Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting and preventing Aadhaar-related fraud using AI-based models. The system leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for detection and classification tasks, alongside EasyOCR for extracting relevant text from Aadhaar documents.

## Features
- **Detection Model**: Identifies key sections (like name, UID, address) in Aadhaar documents.
- **Classification Model**: Classifies documents based on predefined categories.
- **OCR Model**: Extracts text from detected regions for verification and validation.
